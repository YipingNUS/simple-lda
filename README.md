simple-lda
==========

A group project to study the paper and code lda together

The authors of this code are Chen Tao and Yiping

We did not keep efficiency in mind when coding, nor is it 
intended to be a off-the-shelf toolkit used by the public. 

We code it to learn LDA from scratch. The implementation 
follows strictly to the paper "Parameter Estimation for 
Text Analysis":
